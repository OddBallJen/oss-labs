# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

## 2 Reading
How to answer questions in a smart way (my experience):
1. First get to know how much the other person knows instead of just assuming they do know a bunch of stuff. 
There are maybe a concept the other person didn't understand that might be important to the question. 
2.Explain the problem first and  walk them through the problem and try to guide them to form answers themselves
instead of just telling them the answer straight away.

## 6 Open Source Analysis
(I wasn't able to get on RCOS's website but I potentially want to work on one of that because I like contributing to RPI's projects.) 
I want to evaluate Submitty and work on Submitty because I think it would be a really interesting time. I want to see how Submitty does things in the backend. 
Professor Kuzmin told us about an interesting error that only appeared a small amount of time and he only saw it because he happened to really looked at the code, 
it was that poll results and their names are switched. (which made it seems like his class didn't want an extra-credit) I thought that was interesting
so I want to get to know Submitty more.
