It's important to choose a license because it indicates that the software is free to use. A license protects the rights of the user and the creator, and there
are clear terms uner the license. 

### 4 
It's important that one shouldn't use a project with an explicit license because it may not be "free" and there might be different permissions than those
with a clear license. One could potentially get in trouble using the software

I agree with this claim largely. I think that failure to follow the open systems model in this case did indeed bring Gopher's downfall. There were no open communication and no unified community developed software. But I think it's important to state what your goal for the software is when developing it. Because 
handing it off to a community has a risk of it might not going in the direction that you want.

Android - For Android they use the Apache license because it allows users to use it, distribute it, modify it and distribute the modified version. A lot of 
applications that runs on Androids are distributed under the same license and it allows for a wider development and better environment since not everything is 
tightly controlled. 

Linux allows users to run, study, share and modify. It complies with the goal that the creator wants the sorce code to be always available and people
are free to change it. 

Microsoft uses MIT, which allows for commercial and private use, modification and distribution because they want people to contribute to it, modify it and 
potentially use the modifications. 

SailfishOS - It is not offically Open Source and there's a lot of third parties modications. I don't really get the point of them not being open souce though. I guess 
it is because some of them are branches therefore they don't want to be distributed??
