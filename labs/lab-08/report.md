### Checkpoint 2

**Q1:** Find the Nightly and Experimental sections and look at some of the submissions. How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission?

**Ans**: You can click on the numbers for each section under "Test", to see which tests are passed, failed or had not run. 

**Q2:** Find a submission with errors. Can you see what the error condition was? How does this help you debug the failure?

**Ans:**

They help me debug because they tell me what the line number is and they tell me what exactly went wrong, so therefore I can debug the failure with these hints. 

**Q3:** Find a system that is close to your specific configuration in the Nightly, Nightly Expected or one of the Masters sections. How clean is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with?

**Ans:**
